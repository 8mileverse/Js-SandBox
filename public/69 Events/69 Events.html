    <h3>69 Events</h3>


    <p>

        Welcome to events in javascript. any interaction that the user has with the web page from the action buttons all the way. all the way down to the loading of the page is an event and we can listen for these events. and call them event handlers. We are going to learn all about all kinds of events keyboard. events forms of mission events events, delegation and bubbling and lot more. The knowledge we have gotten from DOM. will be seriously applied in events and in the next project or rather in the next section we will be building our shopping list product from scratch. Thank you.
