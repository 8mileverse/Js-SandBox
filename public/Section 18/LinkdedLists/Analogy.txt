 Let’s explain the code using a **restaurant analogy** while staying technical.

   **1. Class: Node**
 javascript
 class Node {
   constructor(value) {
     this._value = value;  The data stored in the node (e.g., table number or customer order)
     this.next = null;     Points to the next table in line (or null if no next table)
   }
 }

 - Think of each `Node` as a **table in a restaurant**.
   - `_value`: The **customer seated at the table** (e.g., "Table 100 is occupied").
   - `next`: The **pointer to the next table** that needs to be served.
   - Initially, every table has no connection (`next = null`), like when the restaurant is empty.

 ---

  **2. Class: LinkedLists**
 javascript
 class LinkedLists {
   constructor() {
     this._head = null;   First table in the restaurant (starting point)
     this._length = 0;    Total number of tables occupied
   }
 }

 - The `LinkedLists` class represents the **entire restaurant**.
   - `_head`: The **first table** served or seated (starting point for all operations).
   - `_length`: The **total number of occupied tables** (tracks how busy the restaurant is).

 ---

  **3. Adding the First Customer (`insertFirst`)**
 javascript
 insertFirst(value) {
   const newNode = new Node(value);  A new table is created with the customer
   newNode.next = this._head;       This table is linked to the current first table
   this._head = newNode;            This new table becomes the first table
   this._length++;                  Increase the table count
 }

 - A **new customer enters the restaurant** and takes the **first table**:
   1. A new `Node` (table) is created with their details.
   2. The new table points to the current first table (`this._head`).
   3. The new table becomes the **first table**.
   4. The waiter updates the count of occupied tables (`_length`).

 ---

  Example:
 - Initial: No customers (`_head = null`).
 - Customer 100 arrives:  
   **Head → [100]**  
   Length = 1.  
 - Customer 200 arrives and takes the first spot:  
   **Head → [200] → [100]**  
   Length = 2.

 ---

  **4. Adding a Customer to the Last Table (`insertLast`)**
 javascript
 insertLast(value) {
   const newNode = new Node(value);  Create a new table for the customer
   let current = this._head;        Start at the first table

   while (current.next) {           Walk through all tables to find the last one
     current = current.next;
   }

   current.next = newNode;          Link the new table to the last one
   this._length++;                  Increase the table count
 }

 - A **new customer arrives and wants the last available table**:
   1. A new `Node` (table) is created.
   2. The waiter walks through all occupied tables to find the **last one**.
   3. The new table is added at the end of the chain.
   4. The table count (`_length`) is updated.

 ---

  Example:
 - Existing tables: **[200] → [100]**.
 - Customer 50 takes the last table:  
   **[200] → [100] → [50]**.  
   Length = 3.

 ---

  **5. Adding a Customer at a Specific Table (`insertAt`)**
 javascript
 insertAt(value, index) {
   if (index > this._length) return;  Invalid table index

   if (index === 0) {                 If it's the first table
     this.insertFirst(value);
     return;
   }

   const newNode = new Node(value);   Create a new table
   let current = this._head;          Start at the first table
   let previous;                      Track the table before the current one
   let count = 0;

   while (count < index) {            Walk to the desired table position
     previous = current;
     current = current.next;
     count++;
   }

   newNode.next = current;            Link the new table to the next one
   previous.next = newNode;           Link the previous table to the new one
   this._length++;                    Update the table count
 }

 - A **customer requests a specific table (index)**:
   1. The waiter finds the requested table position.
   2. A new `Node` (table) is created.
   3. The new table is linked between the **previous table** and the **next table**.
   4. The table count is updated.

 ---

  Example:
 - Existing tables: **[200] → [100] → [50]**.
 - A new customer wants to sit at position 1 (between 200 and 100).  
   New arrangement: **[200] → [1] → [100] → [50]**.  
   Length = 4.

 ---

  **6. Finding a Customer’s Table (`getAt`)**
 javascript
 getAt(index) {
   let current = this._head;   Start at the first table
   let count = 0;              Track the table position

   while (current) {           Walk through the tables
     if (count === index) {    If it's the desired table
       console.log(current._value);  Show the customer at the table
     }

     count++;
     current = current.next;
   }

   return null;  If the index is out of range
 }

 - A **waiter is asked, “Who is sitting at Table X?”**:
   1. Start at the first table and count positions.
   2. If the requested table is found, return the customer’s details.

 ---

  Example:
 - Tables: **[200] → [1] → [100] → [50]**.
 - Query: "Who is at Table 2?"  
   Answer: **100**.

 ---

  **7. Removing a Customer from a Table (`removeAt`)**
 javascript
 removeAt(index) {
   if (index > this._length) return;  Invalid table index

   let current = this._head;         Start at the first table
   let previous;
   let count = 0;

   if (index === 0) {                Removing the first table
     this._head = current.next;      Make the second table the new first
     return;
   }

   while (count < index) {           Walk to the desired table
     count++;
     previous = current;
     current = current.next;
   }

   previous.next = current.next;     Skip the removed table
   this._length--;                   Update the table count
 }

 - A **customer leaves their table**:
   1. The waiter finds the table to remove.
   2. The connections between tables are adjusted to skip over the empty table.
   3. The table count is updated.

 ---

  Example:
 - Tables: **[200] → [1] → [100] → [50]**.
 - Table 1 (index 1) is removed:  
   **[200] → [100] → [50]**.  
   Length = 3.

 ---

  **8. Printing the List (`printListData`)**
 javascript
 printListData() {
   let current = this._head;   Start at the first table
   let list = "";              To store the sequence of customers

   while (current) {           Walk through all tables
     list += current._value + " ";  Add the customer to the list
     current = current.next;
   }

   console.log(list);  Print the sequence
 }

 - The waiter is asked to **list all occupied tables** in order.

 ---

  Example:
 - Tables: **[200] → [100] → [50]**.
 - Output: `"200 100 50"`.

 ---

 This analogy keeps the linked list structure grounded in a restaurant's operations, making it easier to visualize how nodes, pointers, and operations work!
